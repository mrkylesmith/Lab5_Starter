1. You are developing at the intersection of several different technologies, you need to consider how the language conventions of each separate language interact with one another. It is important to name IDs and classes consistently and in a way that will not result in CSS or JS errors when accessing different HTML elements.

2. Data attributes are a way to associate more specific data with a particular HTML element and they are useful if you want to associate extra data with this element. You access them using the `dataset` property combined with dot notation for the particular attribute or by using the `getAttribute()` method with the attribute name as a string.

3. A DOM fragment is a small document object that doesn't have a parent. The document fragment is like a standard document, but isn't part of the active tree structure of the document, so changes to this DOM fragment won't be reflected in the document. This could be beneficial for performance if you want to add lightweight interactions to the minimal DOM new elements, without interacting with the standard document.

4. The Virtual DOM is basically a lightweight copy or representation of an actual DOM element, containing the same properties. The virtual DOM can be updated quickly compared to the DOM, but changes to the virtual DOM are not reflected on the screen.
